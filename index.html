  <h1> Learning Styles </h1> 
  
 <h3> Failure </h3> 
  <p>
  In both Muller and Dweck’s videos, there is an emphasis on failure as a necessary part of the learning process. For Muller, prompting people with questions invites the possibility of failure. This Socratic method of question and answer is much more effective than just receiving an answer as Muller points out in his video. In order for this method to work, a student has to be willing to answer questions and be wrong sometimes. Dweck points out that in order to grow, you must embrace failure and learn from it. The successful growth mindset does this but the fixed mindset is content with pushing away failure and pretending like it didn’t happen. In Muller’s first video about trees, you could see people that had the growth mindset Dweck discussed. Those with a growth mindset remarked that they had not thought much about the question and were curious about the answer after making their best guesses. Any people that Muller asked to interview and refused would be considered to have a fixed mindset because they did not want to look foolish on camera.

 <h3> Failure at Centre </h3>
   
  <p>
  Muller’s approach to learning reminded me about a professor I’ve had at Centre. The best professor I’ve had (so far) has been Dr. Workman for organic chemistry. It’s also been the hardest class I’ve ever taken. Depending on who you talk to, Dr. Workman can have a bad reputation. Just like the critics in  Muller’s second video, some students think that Dr. Workman is mean or a bully. In reality, Dr. Workman is simply blunt when communicating what a student’s failure is. This makes some students uncomfortable or hurts their feelings and this causes them to dislike Dr. Workman. If you can grow thick skin and realize that mistakes are the cornerstone of learning, you will do well.

    Dr. Workman’s teaching style is very particular. He starts the lecture with a simple questions and we used rules already established to answer them. As the examples he gives get more complicated, we are forced as a class to modify the rules and occasionally create new ones all together. Sometimes the rules we come up with as solutions to problems would work in one case but were not universal. To show us this, Dr. Workman would create a different problem that would eventually lead to a contradiction that caused us to backtrack and remodify our rule. Dr. Workman always led the discussion of new rules in a way that would plant hints and seeds for the next rule, giving us just enough information that we still needed to as a “what if” question to keep the discussion going.

   By allowing us to make those mistakes together as a class and come up with the solutions on our own, we became better acquainted with these new rules and more equipped to create solutions later in our homework and exams. The community aspect of these mistakes is essential, especially early on in the semester. Showing that everyone experiences these failures, especially after the whole class has agreed on an answer that turns out to be wrong, gives students more confidence to take risks and become better learners with a growth mindset rather than a fixed one. When grading, Dr. Workman also takes into consideration improvement over the semester which further encourages students to have the growth mindset Dweck preaches.
